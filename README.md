# IPL-Dashboard-using-Excel
Indian Premier League(IPL) is the most famous sports franchise in India, which began in 2007. So based on data generated overtime, I have made dashboard using Microsoft Excel used functions such as Pivot Table, VLOOKUP, Slicer, etc.

Here we have analysed:

show the toss distribution of teamâ€™s at different venues.
compare the teams by their count number of match wins against each other.
find the number of boundaries by each team season-wise.
